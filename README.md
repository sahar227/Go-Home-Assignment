# Go-Home-Assignment

A Golang home assignment I received as part of an interview process

## How to build and execute

    - Download and install go version 1.15 from https://golang.org/
    - Clone this repo.
    - Go to root project folder.
    - run command: "go build ./cmd/validator".
    - On the root project folder, an executable file called "validator.exe" should be created. Run it to execute the program.
